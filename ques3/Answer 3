Explain abstract class and interface with an example.
ABSTRACT CLASS :-
Any class which is declared as abstract is known as abstract class.
We cannot create object of an abstract class.
An abstract class can have abstract methods or non-abstract methods or a combination of both.
An abstract class need to be extended.
With abstract class, we can achieve partial abstraction (0%to 100%).
We make an class as abstract when we do not want that class' object to get created directly.

INTERFACE :-
Interface is like a blueprint of classes.
We use interface, when we want to get full abstraction, i.e. 100% abstraction.
In interface methods are by default abstract and public.
